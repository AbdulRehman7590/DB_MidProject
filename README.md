# Final Year Project Management System

This repository contains a desktop application developed to streamline the process of managing final year projects at the Department of Computer Science, UET Lahore. The application is designed to be operated by members of the project committee, facilitating centralized data management and automating various tasks involved in the management of final year projects.

## Overview

The Department of Computer Science, UET Lahore, holds a committee responsible for managing final year projects. Each year, a list of project titles is compiled by the committee based on ideas from faculty members. Students have the privilege to form groups and select projects from the approved list, after obtaining approval from their faculty advisor. Once a project is selected, an advisory board consisting of a main advisor, co-advisor, and industry advisor is assigned to the project. Throughout the year, multiple evaluations are conducted, which are currently managed through spreadsheets.

## Objective
